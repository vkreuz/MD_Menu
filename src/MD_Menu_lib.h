Menu Systems
============
A menu is a list of options from which the user makes a selection. Each
option is a brief description for a selection (menu label) that can lead
to a sub-menu or a specific action being performed.

The tree data structure is one of the most obvious structures used to represent
menus. In trees information naturally forms a hierarchy - menu entries are
naturally ordered *above* or *below* other entries. The tree data structure
is a very efficient way to represent this type of information. Although a tree
has built-in hierarchical structure, it can be stored as arrays of data.

Tree Structure Primer
---------------------
This structure is named a *tree structure* because the classic representation
resembles a tree, even though the chart is generally upside down compared
to an actual tree, with the *root* at the top and the *leaves* at the
bottom. The tree elements are called *nodes*. The lines connecting nodes
are called *branches*. Nodes with no sub-nodes are called leaf nodes, end
nodes, terminal nodes or leaves.

![A Tree Structure] (Tree_Structure.png "Tree Structure")

A tree is a special kind of graph that follows a particular set of rules
and definitions:
- **Connected** - A graph can be a tree if it is connected. Each node is
connected with a link to at least one other node.
- **Acyclic** - A graph can be a tree if is acyclic (ie, it has no cycles
or loops in it).
That means there's only one route from any node to any other node. This also
means that a node may have many children but only one parent.
- **Root** - The term root commonly refers to a top-most node (ie, the one
with no parent). In the figure above, node F is the root of the tree. The
root is the starting for traversing any tree structure.
- **Descendant** - A descendant is a node that is farther away from the root
than some other node. The term descendant is always referenced from another
node. In the example, nodes I and H are descendants of node G.
- **Parent** - Parent is considered the node that is closer to the root node
by one link or vertex, in the same branch. In the figure, node B is the parent
of nodes A and D. The ultimate parent in a tree is the root node.
- **Sibling** - Sibling (brother or sister) nodes share the same parent. In
the example, nodes A and D are siblings.
- **Ancestor** - An ancestor is any node between a given node and the root,
including the root. In the figure, the ancestors of node H are nodes I, G,
and F.
- **Leaf** or **Terminal Node** - A node is terminal if it has no children. In
the example, node C is a leaf.
- **Height** or **Depth** - The height of a tree is defined as the number of vertices
traversed to get to the most distant node. In the figure, the height of the
tree is equal to three.
